---

If you have a **Discord server**, you can use the [ChainPatrol Discord bot](https://chainpatrol.io/bot)
to let your server members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new
reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

<Tip>
  If you have a dedicated `scam-reports` channel, we recommend adding the bot to
  this channel and directing your server members to use the bot there for easy
  auditing
</Tip>

To add the bot to your server, you need to be an admin of the server. Then, you
can use the following link to add the bot to your server:

[ðŸš€ Add ChainPatrol to your server](/bot/install)

## Usage

Once the bot is added to your server, you can use the following commands to
submit scam reports:

- `/report <url>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the bot to submit a scam report:

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know in our
[Discord server](https://chainpatrol.io/discord).

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and
the Discord ID for the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs
more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any information
about the server it is added to.

## Source Code

The source code for the bot is available on GitHub: [chainpatrol/discord-bot](https://github.com/chainPatrol/discord-bot)
