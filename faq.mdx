    <Accordion title="How do you actually stop scams?">

        We stop scams affecting your organization through a combination of two mechanisms:

        1. **Blocking scams at the wallet** - Our data is integrated into Coinbase Wallet,
        Metamask, Pontem Wallet, and many more. That means that when a user of one of these
        wallets tries to perform a transaction on a domain that is known to be a scam, they
        will be warned and prevented from sending their funds to the scammer.

        2. **Takedowns of scam websites & social profiles** - We work with domain registrars and
        hosting providers to take down scam websites. This prevents users from being able to
        access the scam website even if they are not using a wallet with our data integrated.

        Together, these two mechanisms ensure that your users are protected from scams no matter
        the surface area your community interacts with.

    <Accordion title="How do you know what is a scam?">

        We use a combination of automated and manual processes to verify that a domain or contract
        address is a scam. We look at details like the domain name, the content of the website,
        the social profiles associated with the domain, the presence of wallet drainer code, and
        many more features.

        We also have a team of analysts who manually verify a small portion of submitted reports before they
        are added to our database. By combining these two approaches, we are able to reduce the risk
        of false positives and ensure that our data is as accurate as possible.
