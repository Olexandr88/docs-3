## What is a webhook?

A webhook is a way for applications to be notified of events in ChainPatrol in real-time. ChainPatrol uses webhooks to notify your wallet about changes to our global blocklist. This allows your wallet to update its blocklist in real-time, without having to wait for a scheduled cron job to run. This is especially useful if you opt to use our [Asset List](/external-api/asset-list) endpoint to sync our data as you can update your blocklist as soon as we update ours.

## Steps to set up a webhook

1. Create a local endpoint to receive the webhook
2. Contact us to register your test endpoint
3. Test that your webhook is working correctly
4. Deploy your webhook endpoint to production
5. Contact us to enable your webhook in production

## Event types

### `debug.test`

This event is used for testing your webhook endpoint. It is sent once when we register your webhook endpoint for the first time.

```json
{
  "event": "debug.test",
  "data": {}
}
```

### `asset.status-updated`

This event is sent when the status of an asset changes. The `status` field can be one of `BLOCKED`, `ALLOWED`, or `UNKNOWN`.

```json
{
  "type": "asset.status-updated",
  "created_at": "2023-08-31T00:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "asset_id": 132,
    "type": "URL",
    "content": "https://example.com",
    "status": "BLOCKED"
  }
}
```
