title: ignore()
description: Use this method to ignore a domain when the user chooses to continue at their own risk after seeing a warning
---

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```js Code
await detector.block("google.com");
await detector.ignore("google.com");

console.log(detector.url("https://google.com"));
```

```js Output
{
    ok: true,
    url: "google.com",
    status: "IGNORED"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

<ParamField body="url" type="string" required>

    The URL to ignore. This can be a full URL or a domain.

    Ex. `https://google.com` or `google.com`

</ParamField>

## Return Value

The return value is a promise that resolves when the URL has been added to the local ignorelist. The promise may
reject if the URL is invalid, so we recommend wrapping this in a try/catch block.
