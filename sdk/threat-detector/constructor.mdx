## Modes

There are two modes of operation for the Threat Detector:

- `local`: This mode uses a local database of scam URLs. Use this mode for offline threat detection and testing.
- `cloud`: This mode uses ChainPatrol's cloud service to detect scams.

### Local Mode

To use the local mode, you need to instantiate the `ThreatDetector` class with the `mode` option set to `local`.

```js
const detector = new ThreatDetector({
  mode: "local",
});
```

### Cloud Mode

To use the cloud mode, you need to instantiate the `ThreatDetector` class with the `mode` option set to `cloud` and provide your API key.

```js
const detector = new ThreatDetector({
  mode: "cloud",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="mode" type="'local' | 'cloud'" required>
      The `mode` property controls the mode of operation for the Threat Detector.

      The value of this property can be either `local` or `cloud`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="apiKey" type="string">
      The `apiKey` property is the API Key for accessing ChainPatrol's APIs. We
      recommend using an environment variable to store your API Key.

      This property is required when the `mode` property is set to `cloud`.
      If `proxyUrl` is set, this property is not required as the proxy server
      will handle the authentication.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="proxyUrl" type="string">
      The `proxyUrl` property is an optional property that can be used to
      specify a proxy URL for accessing ChainPatrol's APIs.

      This property is useful when you are behind a firewall or need to use a
      proxy to access the internet.

      This value is only used when the `mode` property is set to `cloud`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="redirectUrl" type="string | (url: string) => string">
      The `redirectUrl` property is an optional property that can be used to
      specify a redirect URL for when the detector detects a scam.

      By default, the detector will return the ChainPatrol warning page URL,
      but you can override this by specifying your own URL.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="storage" type="Storage">
      The `storage` property is an optional property that can be used to
      specify a custom storage adapter for the detector to cache URL lookups.

      By default, the detector will use the `Storage.memory()` adapter, which
      stores the cache database in memory. This means that the database will be
      cleared when the process exits. If you want to persist the database, you
      can use the `Storage.browser()` adapter, which stores the database in
      local storage, or the `Storage.extension()` adapter, which stores the database
      in the browser's extension storage.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
