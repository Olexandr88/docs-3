    The URL to check. This can be a full URL or a domain.

</ParamField>

## Return Value

The return value is a promise that resolves with an object containing the
result of the check.

### Success

If the check was successful, the object will contain the following properties:

<ParamField body="result" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>

    <ParamField body="ok" type="true" required>
      This property will be `true` if the check was successful.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="url" type="string">
      The `url` property is the URL that was checked.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="status" type="'ALLOWED' | 'BLOCKED' | 'UNKNOWN'" required>
      The `status` property indicates whether the URL is allowed or blocked.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="redirectUrl" type="string | (url: string) => string">
      The `redirectUrl` property is an optional property that can be used to
      specify a redirect URL for when the detector detects a threat.

      By default, the detector will return the ChainPatrol warning page URL,
      but you can override this by specifying your own URL.
