title: False positives
description: This article explains our strategy for dealing with false positives.
---

At ChainPatrol, we take false positives very seriously. We've seen many projects try to build fully automated systems that are supposed to be 100% accurate, or systems that rely completely on crowd-sourced data, but we've never seen this work out well. Either the system flags too much data as suspicious, or it flags too little. Either the system is too slow to be useful, or it's too fast to be accurate.

Remember the golden rule: **Garbage in, garbage out.**

We believe that the only way to build a system that is both accurate and useful is to have a human in the loop. We have a team of analysts that review every single report submitted to our platform whether its coming from a Web3 project owner, an automated scan, or from community submission.

An asset will only end up as Blocked in our API if it has been reviewed by a human on our team, or if it has been reviewed by a human working for one of our scanning partners.
