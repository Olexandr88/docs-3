The `Storage.browser()` adapter uses the browser's `localStorage` API to store data.
This adapter should be used by dApps that run in the browser. For browser extensions,
use the [Storage.extension()](./extension) adapter.

## Example

```js
import { Storage } from "@chainpatrol/sdk";

const storage = Storage.browser({
  quota: 1024 * 1024 * 2, // 2MB
});
```

## Limitations

The `localStorage` API limits the amount of data that can be stored to 5MB. We recommend
using the `quota` option to limit the amount of data that is stored to avoid hitting
this limit, especially if you are storing other data in `localStorage` as well.
