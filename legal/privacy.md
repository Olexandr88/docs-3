# Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions apply to your use of the ChainPatrol Inc. (“ChainPatrol”) website,
located at [http://www.chainpatrol.io](http://www.chainpatrol.io) (the “Website”), and the services offered by ChainPatrol (the
“Services”) to our users and customers (the “End-User” or “you”). Supplemental terms and
conditions or documents that may be posted on the Website or changes to the Services from
time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We will alert you of any
changes by updating the “Last Updated” date of these Terms and Conditions, and you waive
any right to receive specific notice of each such change. By using any of ChainPatrol’s Services,
visiting the Website, or completing a sign-up or purchasing process on the Website, you are
deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:

**About the Service**

ChainPatrol is a Web3 Security company that helps protect your community and brand
information from scammers. We use 24/7 monitoring to detect scammers targeting your
community across Twitter, Discord, Telegram and Google Ads. ChainPatrol gets these scams
blocked at the crypto-wallet level, preventing users from signing malicious transactions. We
work with various crypto-wallet companies to create a blocklist that warns against suspicious or
scam URLs. End-Users can create a manual report through ChainPatrol’s security dashboard
when End-Users or their team detect an external scammer or when End-Users or their team
have been hacked. The Services also enable End-Users to block their own domains in the case
of a DNS attack, all of which is made available to organizations through organization-specific
security portals. ChainPatrol provides our Services to End-Users in the Province of Ontario,
throughout Canada, and internationally where permissible by local law. If you are accessing our
Website or Services from a jurisdiction outside Canada, you hereby acknowledge and agree
that your use of the Website or Services shall, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable
law, remain at all times subject only to the laws of Ontario and Canada. To the extent applicable
by law, we reserve the right to deny or terminate services to any End-User at our discretion.

ChainPatrol makes every effort to ensure materials on the Website are displayed accurately with
the same colours and images across different computers and devices. However, ChainPatrol
cannot guarantee that your computer or device will accurately or consistently display image
colours and sizing.

**User Accounts**

You will require a dedicated member profile and account to access the Services (the “User
Account”). In order to register for a User Account, End-Users must provide their first name, last
name, email address, organization name, link to their website, and chosen password on our
“Request Access” page.

Within an Account, you can:

- Create a member profile for your organization;
- View and interact with your dedicated security dashboard;
- View reports of detected scamming attempts;
- Review our scammer blocklist;
- Verify your transactions for potential scams;

- Block your domain to stop DNS attacks;
- Report potential scams;
- Access other functionalities developed and released by ChainPatrol from time to time.

**Interacting with the Website**

When using the Website and our Services, you acknowledge and agree that you will (1) provide
true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Website
(“Registration Data”); (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true,
accurate, current and complete; and (3) enter valid payment information. You must at all times
provide accurate and truthful information regarding your identity when completing a purchase
through the Website and may not complete a purchase for another individual without their
explicit written permission. ChainPatrol reserves the right to suspend or cancel your access to
the Services at its sole discretion at any time and for any reason upon notice to you.

When you register for an Account, you will be asked to choose a username and password for
the Account or to sign up through a third-party provider. By registering for an Account, you are
indicating that you agree to these Terms of Use. You are entirely responsible for safeguarding
and maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and agree not to share your
username or password with any person who is not authorized to use your Account. We will
assume that any person using the Website with your username and password, either is you or is
deemed to be authorized to act for you. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect or
become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or any unauthorized access to the
password for any Account. You further agree not to use the Account or log in with the username
and password of another user of the Website if (a) you are not authorized to use either or (b) the
use would violate the Terms of Use.

You are responsible for updating your account access passwords regularly. It is strongly
recommended that passwords or login information or any other confidential information not be
shared by email unless encrypted.

End-Users are responsible to ensure that all End-User generated content (“User Content”)
complies with our Site Content Standards detailed herein. User Content will be stored using our
secure cloud server for all active End-Users but may be deleted upon termination of the
Services. User Content will never be shared or utilized by ChainPatrol other than as necessary
for the provision of its Services. User Accounts may be accessed via third party web browser
access at [http://www.chainpatrol.io.](http://www.chainpatrol.io.)

ChainPatrol also reserves the right to suspend or end the Services if you are found to be in
breach of these Terms and Conditions, or for any other reason subject to these Terms and
Conditions.

**Fees**

All service agreements must be entered directly between the End-User and ChainPatrol. Fees
for User Account access are charged on a monthly subscription basis. Fees for User Accounts
and our other Services are specified on our Website and are subject to change at any time in
our sole discretion. Fees for all other Services are set individually with the client and specified in
a client contract. Additional fees may apply for some Services. Fees may vary due to tax rates in

various provinces across Canada, the United States and internationally. If you desire a quote for
a custom product or service, please contact us at support@chainpatrol.io.

All prices are shown in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and are exclusive of applicable taxes.

ChainPatrol accepts no liability to complete any transaction which cannot be cleared by
ChainPatrol’s payment processor, whether due to insufficient funds or otherwise. If such
situation occurs, you will receive an error message and the transaction will be denied. Moreover,
we may suspend your access to your Account and contact you to provide valid alternative credit
card information. Such suspension shall not relieve you from your obligation to pay any fees
owed to ChainPatrol.

All End-User payments must be paid immediately at the time of purchase or in accordance with
your contract with ChainPatrol. You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect
for your purchases, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such
amounts upon making your purchase. If your purchase is subject to recurring charges, then you
consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your
approval for each recurring charge, until you notify us of your cancellation in writing.

Payments may be processed through a third-party payment processing service from time to
time. End-Users shall make all payments in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms
in effect at the time of purchase. ChainPatrol reserves the right at any time to change its prices
and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Website or by email delivery to the
End-User, subject to any agreed-upon terms in a signed contract with ChainPatrol.

You further agree to promptly update account and payment information, including email
address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your
transactions and contact you as needed.

By providing credit card information through the Website and authorizing payments with the
credit card, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (a) you are legally authorized to provide
such information; (b) you are legally authorized to make payments using the credit card(s); (c) if
you are an employee or agent of an organization or person that owns the credit card, that you
are authorized by the organization or person to use the credit card to make payments on the
Website; and (d) such actions do not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of
such credit card(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a credit card via the
Website, End-User represents and warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to
complete the payment using the designated credit card. To the extent that any amounts owed
under these Terms of Use cannot be collected from your credit card(s), you are solely
responsible for paying such amounts by other means.

We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already
requested or received payment. We also reserve the right to refuse any order placed through
the Website.

**Taxes**

You take sole responsibility for the payment of any sales tax and any related penalties or
interest to the relevant tax authority if you fail to pay the sales tax for the Services (the “Sales
Tax”). You hereby indemnify ChainPatrol for any liability or expense we may incur in connection

with such Sales Taxes. You may be required to provide ChainPatrol with evidence that you have
paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use
tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that ChainPatrol is permitted to pass to its
End-Users, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing
jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

**Cancellation and Refund Policy**

ChainPatrol reserves the right to terminate any Services for any reason at any time, including
the ending of services that are already underway, subject to the terms in a signed contract with
ChainPatrol. If any payment processing request is rejected at any time for any reason, the
Services shall be immediately terminated and you will be notified of the termination within ten
(10) business days thereafter.

All purchases are non-refundable. You may cancel your User Account with ChainPatrol at any
time, through the settings page within your User Account. In the event you cancel your account,
you will be billed for all applicable fees up until the date of such cancellation. No refunds shall
be offered where a Service is deemed to have been completed by ChainPatrol in its sole
discretion, reasonably exercised.

If you are unsatisfied with our services, please email us at support@chainpatrol.io and we will
address your concerns in a prompt and timely manner.
