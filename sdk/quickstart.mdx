While, this SDK is designed to be in the browser, on a server, or in an extension.
The most common use-case for using the ChainPatrol SDK is if you're
building a browser extension-based wallet.

The code snippet below shows how to use the SDK in the background script of a
browser extension, demonstrating 3 core concepts:

- Instantiating the `ScamDetector`
- Listening for navigation events
- Using the `ScamDetector` to check a URL, and redirecting the user if the URL is
  a scam

```js background.js
import { ScamDetector } from "@chainpatrol/sdk";

// Instantiate the detector
const detector = new ScamDetector({
  mode: "cloud",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// Listen for navigation events
chrome.webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate.addListener(async ({ url, tabId }) => {
  const result = await detector.url(domain);
  if (result.ok && result.status === "BLOCKED") {
    // Redirect the user to the warning page
    chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {
      url: result.redirectUrl,
    });
  }
});
```

These concepts are generally applicable to other environments as well. For example
if you're using the SDK in a messaging web application, instead of listening for
navigation events using `chrome.webNavigation`, you would listen for navigation
events for links clicked in the application, or you could instead wait until the
user initiates a transaction and check the URL that initiated the transaction.

The next sections of the documentation will go into more detail about the
different classes exported by the SDK, and how to use them.
