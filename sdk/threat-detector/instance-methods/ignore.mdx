title: ignore()
description: Use this method to ignore a domain when the user chooses to continue at their own risk after seeing a warning
---

If a user chooses to continue at their own risk after seeing a warning, you can use this method to ignore the
domain so that the detector ignores the domain in the future. Without this, the user will continue to be redirected
to the warning page, which is not a good user experience.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```js Code
await detector.ignore("google.com");

console.log(await detector.url("https://google.com"));
```

```js Output
{
    ok: true,
    url: "google.com",
    status: "IGNORED"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

<ParamField body="url" type="string" required>

    The URL to ignore. This can be a full URL or a domain.

    Ex. `https://google.com` or `google.com`

</ParamField>

## Return Value

The return value is a promise that resolves with a result object.

### Success

If the addition was successful, the object will contain the following properties:

<ParamField body="result" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>

    <ParamField body="ok" type="true" required>
      This property will be `true` if the addition was successful.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="url" type="string">
      The `url` property is the URL that was added.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Failure

However, if the addition was unsuccessful, the object will contain the following:

<ParamField body="result" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>

    <ParamField body="ok" type="false" required>
        This property will be `false` if the addition was unsuccessful.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="url" type="string">
      The `url` property is the URL that we tried to add.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="error" type="string">
      The `error` property will contain a human-readable error message.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
