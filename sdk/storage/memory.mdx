title: Memory

The `Storage.memory()` adapter stores data in memory. This is the default adapter when you instantiate
a new `ScamDetector` instance.

We don't recommend using this adapter in production, as it will not persist data between sessions. But
it is useful for testing and development.

## Example

```js
import { Storage } from "@chainpatrol/sdk";

const storage = Storage.memory({
  quota: 1024 * 1024 * 2, // 2MB
});
```
