## What is a Canary Token?

Canary Tokens are a free, open-source tool that helps you discover when bad actors access your data. They can be used to detect unauthorized access to your website, documents, or other sensitive information.

You can read more on the [Canary Tokens website](https://docs.canarytokens.org/guide/).

## Cloned Website Tokens

Cloned Website Tokens are a type of Canary Token that can be used to detect when your website is cloned. They work by embedding a unique token into your website that is invisible to your users. When a bad actor clones your website, they will also clone the token. When the token is accessed, you will be notified and ChainPatrol will proceed to block and takedown the malicious cloned site.

You can read more about Cloned Website Tokens on the [Canary Tokens website](https://docs.canarytokens.org/guide/cloned-web-token.html).
